        <p>This conference will focus on the major environmental challenges currently faced globally, with particular emphasis on the mechanisms of air pollution and extreme weather, as well as strategies for addressing them. As global warming progresses, the frequency and intensity of extreme events continue to increase, posing serious threats to ecosystems and public health. The conference aims to address meteorology, environment, health, urban science, and their interdisciplinary fields, covering physics, chemistry, computer science, social sciences, and public health. It will focus on exploring interactions between disciplines to promote collaborative research across fields, hoping to generate novel insights and research methodologies. Experts and scholars from around the world will be invited to share their latest research findings on related issues and discuss response strategies and policy recommendations, thereby advancing the scientific community's understanding of these issues and the formulation of solutions. Additionally, the conference will provide a platform for participants to exchange ideas, promote international collaboration, and enhance society's awareness and ability to respond to extreme events. </p>
